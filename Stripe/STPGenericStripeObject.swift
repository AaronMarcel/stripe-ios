/// Generic decodable Stripe object. It only has an `id`
/// `STPAPIRequest` expects to be able to parse an object out of the result, otherwise
/// it considers the request to have failed.
/// This primarily exists to handle the response to calls like these:
/// - https://stripe.com/docs/api#delete_card + https://stripe.com/docs/api#detach_source
/// - https://stripe.com/docs/api#customer_delete_bank_account
/// This will probably never be useful to expose publicly, the caller probably already has the
/// id.
